# Final-Craigslist-Buildout

Hello! Thank you for opening the ReadMe

This is my buildout of my Craigslist redesign from Web 1. I made some notible changes from the previous design that I will now list

-Navigation on the main page is now a series of icons in the header, my calendar page is underneath the calendar icon in the header. Clicking on it should direct you to the calendar page. While the other icons don't have functioning websites behind them, they represent the categories, post, explore, calendar, and about pages respectivly
-Hero image spans the entire home screen, does not have margins on the side 
-Home page calendar elements have been reversed, I just felt they made more sense that way
-Calendar filters always display on the calendar page for ease of use
-Could not figure out how to round the corners on the google map included in the site, so they are pointy
